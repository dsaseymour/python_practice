#The raise_for_status() method is a good way to ensure that a program
#halts if a bad download occurs. This is a good thing: You want your program
#to stop as soon as some unexpected error happens. If a failed download isnâ€™t
#a deal breaker for your program, you can wrap the raise_for_status() line
#with try and except statements to handle this error case without crashing.
